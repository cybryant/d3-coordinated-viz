            <h4>-- Use this tool to explore possible relationships between restaurant types and health indicators for each state --</h4>

            <p>More and more social media and other advertising campaigns are touting health and environmental benefits of plant-based foods. Even Burger King and Dunkin are carrying "Beyond Meat" options using plant based proteins.</p> 
                
            <p>This presents an interesting area to study over time and see whether the increase in those plant based food options result in reductions in heart disease, obesity, diabetes, and other diseases. While it will probably take more years of data to reliably study any real trends, this tool is a starting point to examine whether there are existing state level correlations.</p> 
            
            <p>While some fast food chains are starting to offer healthier options, this tool generally assumes fast food is less healthy overall and therefore provides fast food numbers as a contrast to the vegan/vegetarian numbers.</p>
